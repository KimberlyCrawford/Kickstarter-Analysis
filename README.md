# Analysis of Kickstarting Campaigns using Excel
A Kickstarter analysis to uncover trends and patterns for successful campaigns.

## Overview of Project
An upcoming playwrite wants to launch a Kickstarter campaign to fund the play "FEVER" with a $10,000 budget and needs insight to plan the campaign and set it up for success. Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform available to fund creative projects. For more information, visit https://www.kickstarter.com/about. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine if there are specific factors that make a crowdfunding campaign successful or not. Analyzing an Excel dataset of over 4,000 crowdfunding campaigns and data can help a client gain a greater understanding of campaigns from start to finish and allow the client to set the campaign to mirror successful ones in the same category.

## Analysis and Challenges
Using Excel; the data was organized, sorted and filtered specifically for “theater” categories and “play” subcategories. Color-coded conditional formatting was applied to the dataset to easily distinguish between four outcomes: Successful, Failed, Canceled, and Live. Goals and pledged columns were sorted to research projects with similar budgets. Data was filtered and pivot tables were generated to get a refined review of the data. Summary statistics were calculated and interpreted.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Explain any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered. 

## Results

- Based on Chart 1 above, the following two conclusions can be made:
1. A trend of "theater" parent category outcomes based on launch date in months revealing higher success rates than failed or cancelled campaigns with 61% successful, 36% failed and 3% canceled. Therefore, a client can expect a higher success rate of getting the campaign funded.
2. A greater success rate of campaigns were held during the months of May and June with May being the highest. However; you will also notice December had roughly the same number of failed campaigns (50% successful versus 46% failed) launched with only a 4% difference. The month of October came in second place with 57% successful versus 43% failed. Therefore, a client should launch a "theater" campaign during the months of May or June.

- Based on Chart 2 above, the following conclusion can be made:
1. A greater success rate for campaign goals between $1-$15,000 and $35,000 - $45,000 and a higher failure rate for campaign goals between $20,000 - $35,000 and any goal over $45,000. Therefore, a client seeking $10,000 to fund a play has a higher success rate versus failure rate. However, the success rate is only 10% higher than the failure rate. A goal of $5,000 has a much higher success rate of 73% versus 27% failure rate.
