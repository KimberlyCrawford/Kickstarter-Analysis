# Analysis of Kickstarting Campaigns using Excel
A Kickstarter analysis to uncover trends and patterns for successful campaigns.

## Overview of Project
An upcoming playwrite wants to launch a Kickstarter campaign to fund the play "FEVER" with a $10,000 budget and needs insight to plan the campaign and set it up for success. Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform available to fund creative projects. For more information, visit https://www.kickstarter.com/about. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine if there are specific factors that make a crowdfunding campaign successful or not. Analyzing an Excel dataset of over 4,000 crowdfunding campaigns and data can help a client gain a greater understanding of campaigns from start to finish and allow the client to set the campaign to mirror successful ones in the same category.

## Analysis and Challenges
Using Excel; the data was organized, sorted and filtered specifically for “theater” categories and “play” subcategories. Color-coded conditional formatting was applied to the dataset to easily distinguish between four outcomes: Successful, Failed, Canceled, and Live. Goals and pledged columns were sorted to research projects with similar budgets. Data was filtered and pivot tables were generated to get a refined review of the data. Summary statistics were calculated and interpreted.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Explain any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the above "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" chart, two conclusions can be made: (1) A trend of outcomes based on launch date in months revealing higher success rates than failed or cancelled. (2) A greater success rate of campaigns were held during the months of May and June with May being the highest. However; you will also notice January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
One conclusion is made about the Outcomes based on Goals (2 pt).

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There is a summary of the limitations of the dataset, and there is a
